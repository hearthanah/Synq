# Synq
Synq, an iOS music player application. In the works.

This code is added to the repo, but here is where i got the resource to bypass Transport Security Exceptions
http://ste.vn/2015/06/10/configuring-app-transport-security-ios-9-osx-10-11/

$ gem install sinatra

$ ruby spotify_token_swap.rb

*you might need these:
  $ gem install bundle
  
  $ bundle install

$ ruby spotify_token_swap.rb


You will need to revert the simulator and iOS to a previous version. I reverted to 8.4
