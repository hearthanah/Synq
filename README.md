# Synq
Synq, an iOS music player application. In the works.

** as a note to our selves
Here is where we got the resource to bypass Transport Security Exceptions

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN SPOTIFY TOKEN
$ gem install sinatra

$ ruby spotify_token_swap.rb

*you might need these:
  $ gem install bundle
  
  $ bundle install

$ ruby spotify_token_swap.rb

You will need to revert the simulator and iOS to a previous version. I reverted to 8.4 and this current implementation works best in an iphone 6 simulator.

ALPHA: Our application connects with spotify, plays one designated song and show cases the album art as well as track and artist name. 

BETA: tba

RELEASE: tba
